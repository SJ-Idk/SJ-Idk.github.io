                    Avatar: The Last Airbender (commonly abbreviated 
                    as ATLA[2]), also known as Avatar: The Legend of 
                    Aang in some regions, or simply Avatar or The 
                    Last Airbender, is an American animated fantasy 
                    action television series created by Michael 
                    Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and produced 
                    by Nickelodeon Animation Studio.

                    Avatar is set in an Asian and Arctic-inspired 
                    world in which some people can telekinetically 
                    manipulate one of the four elements—water, earth, 
                    fire or air—through practices known as "bending", 
                    inspired by Chinese martial arts. The only individual 
                    who can bend all four elements, the "Avatar", is 
                    responsible for maintaining harmony among the world's 
                    four nations, and serves as the link between the 
                    physical world and the spirit world. The series is 
                    centered around the journey of twelve-year-old Aang, 
                    the current Avatar and last survivor of his nation, 
                    the Air Nomads, along with his friends Katara, 
                    Sokka, and Toph, as they strive to end the Fire 
                    Nation's war against the other nations and defeat 
                    Fire Lord Ozai before he conquers the world. 
                    It also follows the story of Zuko—the exiled 
                    prince of the Fire Nation, seeking to restore his 
                    lost honor by capturing Aang, accompanied by his 
                    uncle Iroh—and later, his sister Azula. Avatar is 
                    presented in a style that combines anime with 
                    American cartoons and relies on the imagery of 
                    primarily Chinese culture,[3] with some other East 
                    Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, New World, 
                    Siberian, and Arctic influences.

                    Avatar: The Last Airbender was a ratings success 
                    and received acclaim from critics for its characters, 
                    cultural references, art direction, voice acting, 
                    soundtrack, humor, and themes. These include concepts 
                    rarely touched on in youth entertainment, 
                    including war, genocide, imperialism, 
                    totalitarianism, indoctrination and free 
                    choice.[4] It won five Annie Awards, a Genesis 
                    Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Kids' Choice Award, 
                    and a Peabody Award. The show is regarded by many 
                    critics as one of the greatest animated 
                    television series of all time.

                    Avatar: The Last Airbender is set in a world 
                    where human civilization consists of four nations, 
                    named after the four classical elements: the Water 
                    Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and 
                    the Air Nomads. In each nation, certain people, 
                    known as "benders" (waterbenders, earthbenders, 
                    firebenders, and airbenders), have the ability to 
                    telekinetically manipulate and control the element 
                    corresponding to their nation, using gestures 
                    based on Chinese martial arts. The "Avatar" is 
                    the only individual with the ability to bend 
                    all four elements.

                <p>
                    A century ago, young Avatar Aang, afraid of his 
                    new responsibilities, fled from his home and was 
                    forced into the ocean by a storm. He encased 
                    himself and his sky bison Appa in suspended 
                    animation in an iceberg near the South Pole. 
                    Shortly afterward, Fire Lord Sozin, the ruler of 
                    the Fire Nation, launched a world war to expand 
                    his nation's empire. Knowing that the Avatar 
                    must be an Air Nomad, he carried out a genocide 
                    against the Air Nomads, which he timed with the 
                    arrival of a comet that gives firebenders 
                    tremendous power. A hundred years later, siblings 
                    Katara and Sokka, teenagers of the Southern Water 
                    Tribe, accidentally discover Aang and revive him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first season, Aang travels with Katara and 
                    Sokka to the Northern Water Tribe so he can learn 
                    waterbending and be prepared to defeat the Fire 
                    Nation. Prince Zuko, the banished son of the 
                    current Fire Lord Ozai, pursues them, accompanied 
                    by his uncle Iroh, hoping to capture the Avatar 
                    in order to restore his honor. Aang is also 
                    pursued by Zhao, a Fire Nation admiral aspiring 
                    to win Ozai's favor. When his navy attacks the 
                    Northern Water Tribe, Zhao kills the moon 
                    spirit; Yue, the princess of the tribe, 
                    sacrifices her life to revive it, and Aang 
                    drives off the enemy fleet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second season, Aang learns earthbending 
                    from Toph Beifong, a blind twelve-year-old 
                    earthbending prodigy. Zuko and Iroh, now 
                    fugitives from the Fire Lord, become refugees 
                    n the Earth Kingdom, eventually settling in its 
                    capital Ba Sing Se. Both groups are pursued by 
                    Azula, Zuko's younger sister and a firebending 
                    prodigy. Aang's group travels to Ba Sing Se to 
                    seek the Earth King's support for an attack on 
                    the Fire Nation timed to an upcoming solar 
                    eclipse, during which firebenders will be 
                    powerless. Azula instigates a coup d'état, bringing 
                    the capital under Fire Nation control, and Zuko 
                    sides with his sister. Aang is fatally 
                    wounded by Azula, but he is revived by Katara.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the third season, Aang and his allies invade the 
                    Fire Nation capital during the solar eclipse, but 
                    are forced to retreat. Zuko abandons the Fire Nation 
                    to join Aang and teach him firebending. Aang, raised 
                    by monks to respect all life, wrestles with the 
                    possibility that he will have to kill Ozai to end 
                    the war. When Sozin's comet returns, Aang confronts 
                    Ozai and uses his Avatar powers to strip Ozai of 
                    his firebending ability; meanwhile, Aang's friends 
                    liberate Ba Sing Se, destroy the Fire Nation 
                    airship fleet, and capture Azula. Zuko is crowned 
                    the new Fire Lord and the war comes to an end.

                    is known as a "book", in which each episode is 
                    referred to as a "chapter". Each book takes its

                    Avatar: The Last Airbender was co-created and 
                    produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan 
                    Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in 
                    Burbank, California. Its animation was mostly 
                    done by South Korean studios JM Animation, DR Movie, 
                    and MOI Animation. According to Konietzko, 
                    the series was conceived in early 2001 when 
                    he took an old sketch of a balding, middle-aged 
                    man and imagined the man as a child. He drew the 
                    character herding bison in the sky and showed 
                    the sketch to DiMartino, who was watching a 
                    documentary about explorers trapped at the South Pole.

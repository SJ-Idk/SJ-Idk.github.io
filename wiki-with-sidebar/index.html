                    manipulate one of the <a href="#">four elements</a>-

                    known as "bending", inspired by 
                    <a href="#">Chinese martial arts</a>. The only individual 
                    who can bend all four elements, the "Avatar", is 
                    responsible for maintaining harmony among the world's 
                    four nations, and serves as the link between the

                    Avatar: The Last Airbender is set in a world 
                    where human civilization consists of four nations, 
                    named after the four classical elements: the Water 
                    Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and 
                    the Air Nomads. In each nation, certain people, 
                    known as "benders" (waterbenders, earthbenders, 
                    firebenders, and airbenders), have the ability to 
                    telekinetically manipulate and control the element 
                    corresponding to their nation, using gestures 
                    based on Chinese martial arts. The "Avatar" is 
                    the only individual with the ability to bend 
                    all four elements.

                <p>
                    A century ago, young Avatar Aang, afraid of his 
                    new responsibilities, fled from his home and was 
                    forced into the ocean by a storm. He encased 
                    himself and his sky bison Appa in suspended 
                    animation in an iceberg near the South Pole. 
                    Shortly afterward, Fire Lord Sozin, the ruler of 
                    the Fire Nation, launched a world war to expand 
                    his nation's empire. Knowing that the Avatar 
                    must be an Air Nomad, he carried out a genocide 
                    against the Air Nomads, which he timed with the 
                    arrival of a comet that gives firebenders 
                    tremendous power. A hundred years later, siblings 
                    Katara and Sokka, teenagers of the Southern Water 
                    Tribe, accidentally discover Aang and revive him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first season, Aang travels with Katara and 
                    Sokka to the Northern Water Tribe so he can learn 
                    waterbending and be prepared to defeat the Fire 
                    Nation. Prince Zuko, the banished son of the 
                    current Fire Lord Ozai, pursues them, accompanied 
                    by his uncle Iroh, hoping to capture the Avatar 
                    in order to restore his honor. Aang is also 
                    pursued by Zhao, a Fire Nation admiral aspiring 
                    to win Ozai's favor. When his navy attacks the 
                    Northern Water Tribe, Zhao kills the moon 
                    spirit; Yue, the princess of the tribe, 
                    sacrifices her life to revive it, and Aang 
                    drives off the enemy fleet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second season, Aang learns earthbending 
                    from Toph Beifong, a blind twelve-year-old 
                    earthbending prodigy. Zuko and Iroh, now 
                    fugitives from the Fire Lord, become refugees 
                    n the Earth Kingdom, eventually settling in its 
                    capital Ba Sing Se. Both groups are pursued by 
                    Azula, Zuko's younger sister and a firebending 
                    prodigy. Aang's group travels to Ba Sing Se to 
                    seek the Earth King's support for an attack on 
                    the Fire Nation timed to an upcoming solar 
                    eclipse, during which firebenders will be 
                    powerless. Azula instigates a coup d'état, bringing 
                    the capital under Fire Nation control, and Zuko 
                    sides with his sister. Aang is fatally 
                    wounded by Azula, but he is revived by Katara.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the third season, Aang and his allies invade the 
                    Fire Nation capital during the solar eclipse, but 
                    are forced to retreat. Zuko abandons the Fire Nation 
                    to join Aang and teach him firebending. Aang, raised 
                    by monks to respect all life, wrestles with the 
                    possibility that he will have to kill Ozai to end 
                    the war. When Sozin's comet returns, Aang confronts 
                    Ozai and uses his Avatar powers to strip Ozai of 
                    his firebending ability; meanwhile, Aang's friends 
                    liberate Ba Sing Se, destroy the Fire Nation 
                    airship fleet, and capture Azula. Zuko is crowned 
                    the new Fire Lord and the war comes to an end.

                    of its release there, despite not being featured on 
                    the main page.[8] The show broke the record for 
                    longest consecutive appearance on Netflix's daily 
                    top ten list, with 60 straight days on the list, 
                    one of only two shows in the top ten record holders 
                    that was not a Netflix original series as of July 
                    2020.[16] Later in June 2020, the complete 
                    series became available on Paramount+ (at the 
                    time CBS All Access)[10] and later on Amazon 
                    Prime Video[11] in January 2021.

                    Avatar: The Last Airbender was co-created and 
                    produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan 
                    Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in 
                    Burbank, California. Its animation was mostly 
                    done by South Korean studios JM Animation, DR Movie, 
                    and MOI Animation. According to Konietzko, 
                    the series was conceived in early 2001 when 
                    he took an old sketch of a balding, middle-aged 
                    man and imagined the man as a child. He drew the 
                    character herding bison in the sky and showed 
                    the sketch to DiMartino, who was watching a 
                    documentary about explorers trapped at the South Pole.

                    Konietzko described their early development of 
                    the concept: "There's an air guy along with these 
                    water people trapped in a snowy wasteland ... and 
                    maybe some fire people are pressing down on them".
                    [17] Two weeks later, the co-creators successfully 
                    pitched the idea to Nickelodeon vice-president and 
                    executive producer Eric Coleman.[18]

                    The series was introduced to the public in a 
                    teaser reel at Comic-Con 2004,[19] and premiered on 
                    February 21, 2005.[20]

                    In an interview, Konietzko said: "Mike and I were 
                    really interested in other epic 'Legends & Lore' 
                    properties, like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, 
                    but we knew that we wanted to take a different 
                    approach to that type of genre. Our love for 
                    Japanese anime, Hong Kong action and kung fu 
                    cinema, yoga, and Eastern philosophies led us 
                    to the initial inspiration for Avatar: The Last 
                    Airbender."[21]

                    According to head writer Aaron Ehasz, Konietzko 
                    and DiMartino originally envisioned the series being 
                    three seasons long but Nickelodeon asked Ehasz what 
                    his ideas for a fourth season would be, and he later 
                    discussed these ideas with both Konietzko and 
                    DiMartino. Ehasz believed that a fourth season 
                    would be created but this plan was interrupted when 
                    Konietzko and DiMartino became occupied with 
                    assisting M. Night Shyamalan on the film The Last 
                    Airbender. Ehasz says that Shyamalan insisted they 
                    create a fourth season instead, but Konietzko and 
                    DiMartino wanted to focus on the live-action film as 
                    they were executive producers on the project.[22] 
                    However, Konietzko and DiMartino have denied this, 
                    and claim that a fourth season was never considered 
                    by themselves nor Nickelodeon.[23]

                    A pilot episode for the series was made in 2003. 
                    It was animated by Tin House, Inc., written by 
                    Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and 
                    directed by Dave Filoni. Mitchel Musso voiced Aang 
                    in this pilot but was later replaced by Zach Tyler 
                    Eisen when the show began production. In the episode, 
                    Sokka and his sister Kya (renamed to Katara by the 
                    time the series aired) must travel the world to find 
                    masters for Aang, who is the Avatar; however, they 
                    must evade a critical foe, Prince Zuko of the Fire 
                    Nation, who wants to capture Aang.

                    This episode was first publicly released as one of 
                    the extras in the NTSC season 1 DVD box set, which 
                    were not available with the previously released 
                    individual volumes. As the PAL box set lacks extras, 
                    the episode was not made available on DVD in PAL 
                    regions. The episode was released with audio 
                    commentary from the creators, which unlike commentary 
                    on other episodes in the season is not possible 
                    to disable on the DVD set.[24] On June 14, 2010, 
                    the unaired pilot was made available with and 
                    without commentary for the first time via the 
                    iTunes Store.[25]

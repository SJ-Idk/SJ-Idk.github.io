            <ul>
                <li>1 cup of butter, room temperature.</li>
                <br>
                <li>1 cup of granulated sugar.</li>
                <br>
                <li>1 egg, plus 1 egg yolk.</li>
                <br>
                <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    1 1/2 teaspoons of <a href="#">baking powder</a>.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with 
                    the <a href="#">paddle attachment</a> 
                    mix together the butter and sugar for 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add in the egg, the yolk, vanilla, baking powder, 
                    and salt and mix for 1 minute until smooth, scraping 
                    the sides of the bowl as necessary.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Turn the mixer to low and add in the 
                    flour, mixing until just combined.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Divide the dough in half, removing half from 
                    the mixing bowl.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add in the cocoa powder to the remaining dough 
                    in the mixing bowl and mix until incorporated.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Form each dough into a squared off log, 2- inches 
                    tall and 6- inches long. Make sure both are the same size.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Place dough on a baking sheet and cover with 
                    cling wrap. Place dough into the refrigerator to 
                    chill for at least 1 hour.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Using a sharp knife slice the dough into thirds, 
                    longwise. Then turn the dough one turn and cut 
                    into thirds again. You will have 9 strips. Repeat 
                    the process with the other dough. You will have 
                    18 strips total.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Lay 1 piece of vanilla dough, one piece of chocolate, 
                    and another piece of vanilla on a flat surface next 
                    to each other. Top the 3 strips with alternating 
                    colors. Repeat this once more, so you have a 
                    square log. Press the dough strips together tightly, 
                    keeping the square shape. Repeat this with 
                    the remaining dough.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Refrigerate again for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet 
                    with Reynolds Kitchens® Parchment Paper.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Remove the dough from the refrigerator and 
                    slice into 1/4- inch pieces.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Place the pieces on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Bake for 9-10 minutes, or until set. Transfer 
                    to a wire rack to cool completely.

                <br>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl (or, preferably, in the bowl 
                    of a stand mixer), combine butter and sugar and beat 
                    together with an electric mixer until creamy and 
                    very well-combined. 1 cup (226 g) unsalted butter,
                    ¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add egg yolk, vanilla extract, and salt and beat well. 
                    Pause to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure 
                    that all ingredients are well incorporated. 1 large

                <br>
                <li>
                    With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour until the 
                    flour is completely combined. Again you should pause to 
                    scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. 2 cups + 2 
                    Tablespoons all-purpose flour¹.

                <br>

                <br>

            A few people have commented that their dough was too 
            stiff to pipe. While the dough is a bit stiff (this is 
            important for the cookies to hold their shape) it should not 
            be too stiff to pipe. <b>You will need to use an Ateco 827 tip 
            for best results</b> (I've found that most people having trouble 
            have been using smaller tips), anything smaller or more closed 
            will likely be too difficult to pipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another possible reason for too-stiff dough is that the flour 
            was accidentally over-measured. Please see my post about 
            <a href="#">how to measure flour properly</a> 
            (you should lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup 
            and then level it off, never scoop the flour directly 
            into the measuring cup).
        </p>
        <p>
            I recommend portioning just half the batter at a time because 
            it is easier to pipe the cookie dough if there is less in the bag.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Help! I don't have the right piping tip OR My dough ended up 
            too stiff to pipe!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't have an Ateco 827? Don't kill your hand trying to 
            use a smaller tip! You can instead drop the cookie dough by 
            rounded 1 ½ Tablespoon onto the baking sheet and use the 
            tines of a fork to make a criss-cross pattern (like if 
            you were making peanut butter cookies) and bake as directed.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, the most likely reason for being unable 
            to pipe the dough is if the flour was over-measured 
            (see notes above), the ingredients weren't combined 
            well enough (especially if the butter and sugar weren't 
            well-creamed), or if you're trying to use a piping tip 
            that is too small.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people have reported success with adding a splash 
            of milk to the dough (though keep in mind that because 
            you have lowered the ratio of butter to other ingredients 
            the cookies may not be as buttery/flavorful) or you can also 
            try warming the dough in the piping bag between your hands by 
            squeezing it before piping.
        </p>
        <h4>How To Store</h4>
        <p>
            Butter Cookies will keep for up to 2-3 weeks in an airtight 
            container at room temperature.

            reheat well in the oven. If you don't have a piping bag,

                    Add oil and water and mix until just combined - 
                    it should be a thick, gummy batter, like a wet

                    (Note 3) to 170°C/340°F, or until it takes 20 seconds 
                    for a small cube of bread to turn golden.

                    the oil, snipping with scissors (snip close to oil 
                    surface to avoid splash). Do 3 to 4 per batch, makes

                    <b>Chocolate</b>: Make sure you get chocolate

                    <b>Deep frying</b>: I use a smallish pot 
                    which is large enough to make churros around 
                    17 cm / 7" long. To use minimal oil, the best 
                    is to a wok (because the shape means you can 
                    use less oil for the same surface area 
                    for frying). A deep small skillet also 
                    works great.

                <li>
                    <b>MAKE AHEAD</b>: Do not roll in sugar. Allow to 
                    cool completely, then store in airtight 
                    container (not in fridge). It will go soft. 
                    Reheat in 180C/350F oven for 5 minutes or 
                    until crisp, then roll in sugar.

                    In which case, just adjust by adding a
